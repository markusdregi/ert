Isolated RMS environment
########################

We recommend all users to remove ``RMS_PYTHONPATH`` from their
ERT configuration files when using ERT 2.16 or newer. Users can experience
problems with not having access to Python modules they earlier had access to
within RMS. If so, contact your ERT admins to evaluate the problem.

For Equinor users we have installed a `run_external` command in the RMS
environment that allows our users to reconstruct the environment prior to
launching RMS to allow for executing commands within the standard user
environment from RMS.

Restarting ES-MDA
#################

It is now possible to restart ES-MDA runs from an intermediate iteration. Note
that this requires a bit of care due to the lack of metadata in current storage.
We are aiming at resolving this in the future in the new storage that soon will
be the standard.

After selecting the ES-MDA algorithm, you first need to set `Current case` to
the case you intend to be your first case to reevaluate. After which the
iteration number will be wrongly injected into the `Target case format`, which
you have to remove manually (reset it to the original `Target case format`).
After which you have to set `Start iteration` to the iteration for which you
are to start from; this number must correspond to the iteration number of the
case you have selected as your `Current case`. We recognize that this induces
some manual checking, but this is due to the lack of metadata mentioned above.
We still hope that this can aid our users and prevent the need of a complete
restart due to cluster issues etc.

New database
############

A new storage implementation has been made. The aim is that this will end up
as a more robust storage solution and that it will serve as a large step
towards the future of ERT. The solution is still experimental and **should not be
used for classified data** as of now. To enable the new storate solution use the
command line option `--enable-new-storage` when launching ERT. Note that it
will have to be used while running a case for the data to reside in the new
storage, but that the same data will also be available in the old storage if
you afterwards open ERT without the new storage enabled.

.. code-block:: none

   >>>> ert .... --enable-new-storage

4.0.2 libres
~~~~~~~~~~~~
Bugfixes:
  - Always load GEN_PARAM to ensure correct state before update

New features:
  - Implemented Misfit preprocessor which will allow the user to run a pipeline of jobs to account for correlated observations
  - Implemented new CSV_EXPORT2 job which utilizes fmu-ensemble to do the export.

Improvements:
  - Added reporter functionality to output data to common storage
  - Correlated observations scaling uses SemeioScript with reporter in place of ErtScript
  - Improve error messages in design_kw
  - Correlated observation scaling will report singular values
  - Correlated observation scaling will report scale factor

Version 2.10
------------

Highlighted changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Change in shell script behaviour
################################

The shell script jobs will no longer interpret the first path relative to the
configuration file. This implies that if you want to copy a file from the area
around your configuration file to the runpath, the following copying will not
work anymore:

.. code-block:: none

   FORWARD_MODEL COPY_FILE(<FROM>=my_files/data.txt, <TO>=data.txt)

And the reason is that it is not possible to deduce whether the intent was to
copy a file relative to your configuration file or whether you wanted to copy
(or delete) something that is already in your runpath. This led to mysterious
and strange errors. From now on, you will have to explicitly ask for the path
to be relative to your configuration file using the ``<CONFIG_PATH>`` magic
string:

.. code-block:: none

   FORWARD_MODEL COPY_FILE(<FROM>=<CONFIG_PATH>/my_files/data.txt, <TO>=data.txt)

The above change takes effect for the following shell scripts:
  - ``CAREFUL_COPY_FILE``
  - ``COPY_DIRECTORY``
  - ``COPY_FILE``
  - ``DELETE_DIRECTORY``
  - ``DELETE_FILE``
  - ``MAKE_DIRECTORY``
  - ``MAKE_SYMLINK``
  - ``MOVE_FILE``
  - ``SCRIPT``
  - ``SYMLINK``

Unified ERT binary
###########################
All launches of *ERT* is now to happen through the shell command ``ert``. To get
an overview of the various *ERT* tools, you can run ``ert --help``. You will then be
presented with the following overview.

::

    [scout@desktop ert]$ ert --help
    usage: ert [-h] {gui,text,shell,cli} ...

    ERT - Ensemble Reservoir Tool

    optional arguments:
      -h, --help            show this help message and exit

    Available user entries:
      ERT can be accessed through a GUI or CLI interface. Include one of the
      following arguments to change between the interfaces. Note that different
      entry points may require different additional arguments. See the help
      section for each interface for more details.  

      {gui,text,shell,cli}  Available entry points
        gui                 Graphical User Interface - opens up an independent
                            window for the user to interact with ERT.        
        cli                 Command Line Interface - provides a user interface in
                            the terminal.

Hence, ``ert gui my_config_file`` will launch the *ERT*-gui with the specified
configuration file. For detailed support for each of the options, use ``ert gui
--help`` etc.

ERT command line interface
###########################
The **cli** option listed above is new and will run *ERT* as a command line
interface with no further interaction after initialization. This will be the
supported command line interface of *ERT* in the future.

Forward model monitoring
######################################################
An essential new feature of *ERT 2.4* is a monitoring screen in the GUI
displaying the progress of each forward model in your ensemble. After
initiating the run, press the **Details** button to get an overview of the
progress of each of the forward models. In the view appearing you can click on
a specific realization to get even more details regarding that specific
realization.

Restarting failed realizations
####################################################
If some of your forward models failed there will appear a **Restart** button
when the run has finished, which will rerun only the failed realizations.

Run prior and posterior separately
####################################################
Many users have requested the possibility of running the prior and posterior
independently. This feature already exists in the advanced mode of the GUI, but
to make it more accessible to the users we have now made the advanced mode the
only mode.

To run your prior, you run an **Ensemble Experiment**. Then, to run an update you
click **Run Analysis** from the top menu of the main window; you can then specify
the target and source case and the update will be calculated. To evaluate your
posterior, you then run a new **Ensemble Experiment** with your target case.
After this, you can plot and compare just as if you had run an **Ensemble
Smoother** to begin with.

Generic tooling in the forward model
####################################################
As a first step towards more generic tooling in *ERT* forward models *ERT* will now dump all
parameters with their corresponding values to the runpath as *JSON*. The format
of this file is still experimental and will most likely change in a future
release of *ERT*, but one is still welcome to play around with the extra
possibilities this gives.

Generic templating
######################
Jinja based templating has been a great success in *Everest* and will most
likely be standardized in future version of *ERT* also; both with respect to
configuration templating and templating in the forward model itself. As a first
step towards this, a forward model named *TEMPLATE_RENDER* has been added. It
will load the parameter values that is dumped by *ERT* (described above),
optionally together with user specified *json*- and *yaml*-files and render a
specified template. For more on how to write *Jinja* template, see the official
`documentation <http://jinja.pocoo.org/docs/2.10/>`_.

Eclipse version in forward model
#################################
The recommended way of specifying the eclipse version is to pass ``<VERSION>``
as argument to the forward model ``ECLIPSE100`` instead of using
``ECLIPSE100_<MY_ECL_VERSION>``. The old format of putting the version in the
job name will be deprecated in the future.

Config refactor:

  In this release cycle there have been large amount of changes to the
  code configuring the ERT state; the purpose of these changes has
  been to prepare for further development with Everest. The main net
  change is that a new configuration object - res_config has been
  created ,which holds all the configuration subobjects:

    [`10 <https://github.com/Equinor/res/pull/10/>`__, `14 <https://github.com/Equinor/res/pull/14/>`__, `35 <https://github.com/Equinor/res/pull/35/>`__, `39 <https://github.com/Equinor/res/pull/39/>`__, `45 <https://github.com/Equinor/res/pull/45/>`__, `52 <https://github.com/Equinor/res/pull/52/>`__, `54 <https://github.com/Equinor/res/pull/54/>`__, `58 <https://github.com/Equinor/res/pull/58/>`__-`62 <https://github.com/Equinor/res/pull/62/>`__, `66 <https://github.com/Equinor/res/pull/66/>`__, `75 <https://github.com/Equinor/res/pull/75/>`__]
